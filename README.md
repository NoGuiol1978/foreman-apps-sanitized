## Applications ##

The following repository contains a point-in-time, limited use version of the Foreman Pickaxe agent that's capable of reading stats and performing common operations against Antminer and Whatsminer ASICs.

If you're considering using this application, you're probably in the wrong place!

### Pickaxe ###

Pickaxe is an open-source Java application that will extract metrics from cryptocurrency miners and upload them directly to Foreman.

You can find the documentation and getting started guides for pickaxe on the [Foreman dashboard](https://dashboard.foreman.mn/dashboard/support/pickaxe/).  Note: you must be logged in to view the dashboard and all guides.

At a high-level,

1. Download pickaxe [(latest)](https://github.com/foremanmining/foreman-apps/releases).
2. Unzip pickaxe.
3. Add your API information from [here](https://dashboard.foreman.mn/dashboard/profile/) to `conf/pickaxe.yml`.
4. Start pickaxe.
5. Add miners from your dashboard! :)

Pickaxe queries the APIs built into each miner (most have this, and most are enabled by default).  If you're having trouble getting your miner to update, consult our documentation [here](https://dashboard.foreman.mn/dashboard/support/miners/) - we've documented how every miner needs to be ran so pickaxe can connect to it.

## Requirements ##

- JDK version 8 (or higher)
- Apache Maven (only if building Pickaxe from sources)

## Building ##

To build the entire foreman-apps repository, which will build all of the Foreman applications:

From the top level of the repository:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Upon a successful build, you should see something similar to the following:

```sh
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

[INFO] Finished at: 2018-07-07T19:54:47-04:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 46M/494M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The application distributions can be found in the `target/` folders.  You'll only need one - pick the extension you prefer.

```sh
$ ls -la **/target | grep -E "\.(zip|tar)"
